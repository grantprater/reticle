# Reticle

Vision-based mechanical analysis pipeline for Valorant — measuring the layer of
play the match API structurally cannot see. Python 3.14, four deps, single
process, no ML frameworks.

**Design doc** (the authority on stage numbering and intent):
https://claude.ai/code/artifact/d7c7173f-dc5e-4c1e-9dcc-acded5a486cb
**Store dashboard:**
https://claude.ai/code/artifact/3854df28-3e45-4783-8aee-7e7f062ac461

Section references in docstrings (`SS3`, `SS7`) mean §3, §7 of that doc.

## Running

Always via the venv interpreter — there is no console script:

```
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m reticle <command>
```

Default store is `~/reticle-store` (outside this repo); override with `--store`.
`fixtures/`, `teststore/`, `probe_*/`, `frames_*/` are gitignored scratch.

## Pipeline status

Stage numbers are the design doc's §3 stages, not release versions.

| Stage | What | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 00 Ingest | fingerprint → profile, manifest, no media copied | **done** (`probe`, `ingest`) |
| 01 Gate/segment | frame state → bounded play spans | **rule-based baseline** — `off`/`idle`/`active`, not the doc's trained buy/in-round/post-round/menu/spectate classifier. No labelled data yet. |
| 02 Deterministic extractors | HUD, killfeed, minimap, main-view | **partial** — see below |
| 03 Event proposal | fuse stage-02 into typed candidates | not started |
| 04 VLM adjudication | ambiguous band only | not started |
| 05 Reconcile | source priority + label-free invariants | invariants only (`checks.py`, `verify`) |
| 06 Metrics | pure versioned functions | not started |
| 07 Narrate/query | not started |
| 08 Correction loop | not started |

### Stage 02 detail

Built and populating in the store: round clock, both team scores, HP, shield,
ammo (mag + reserve), killfeed **entry count**, and killfeed **player
attribution** (kill/death, with the stack positions needed to count entries).

Not built: **credits**, **minimap position tracking**, **main-view detection**.

Minimap position tracking is the gating dependency for the doc's peek-exposure
metric and for movement state generally; §2 calls the homography trivial, and
`MinimapMode.has_static_homography` already records per session whether a single
constant transform exists (true for `223d636bf8d2` and `bdfdcf009dba`).

## Open defects

- **Killfeed attribution recall is ~3 entries short per session.** Precision is
  good (32/32 by eye; scoreboard deltas +0/+1, -3/-3, +1/+2 across the three
  full-frame sessions), but `bdfdcf009dba` misses three kills and three deaths.
  Two untried candidates are named in `killfeed.py`. **Treat the counts as +/-3
  per session** and the per-frame flags as high-precision but incomplete.
- **`README.md` is stale.** It says HP, ammo and the killfeed are unbuilt; they
  are built, and it still describes stage 02 as scoreline-only. Fix it when next
  touching that area.
- **Health is not a death signal.** `hp` going unreadable was used as an
  independent death estimate and it is not one — it also goes unreadable in buy
  phase, while scoped, and while spectating. On `b3b9defb6fd7` it produced 20
  "deaths" of which most were a *teammate* dying. Don't reach for it again.

## Before ingesting any new capture

1. **Check the crosshair position.** It must sit at frame centre — (960, 540) at
   1080p. (1280, 720) means OBS is compositing a larger render onto a smaller
   canvas at 1:1 and part of the HUD is *not in the file*. Fix it in OBS.
   `valorant-16x9-crop75` exists only to salvage already-recorded captures
   (`0f08b3dc3777` is one).
2. **Set Valorant's performance stats to text-only**, not graph or both. The
   graph column covers the lower half of the killfeed ROI and cuts usable entry
   slots from six to three — losing exactly the multikills worth measuring.
3. **Turn the shooting-error readout off**, or move it out of the top-right. It
   lands at killfeed-ROI x 337-461, y 136-198, covering 59% of the victim name
   box in stack slot 3 and 26% in slot 4 — precisely where a death is read.
   Entries under it are counted as `kf_unattributed` rather than guessed, so it
   costs lost deaths, not wrong ones.
4. **Run `probe` and look at the frames.** ROI fractions are guesses until you
   have. Everything downstream is wrong until they are right.
5. **Record the minimap settings.** Only fixed + always_same + uncentered gives
   a constant minimap→world transform. Pass
   `ingest --minimap-mode "fixed/always_same/uncentered"`; it lands in the
   manifest.

## Conventions that are load-bearing

- **Never guess a value.** A field the extractor cannot read stays `null`.
  Everything is range-checked before return — a clock of 7:41 is a misread, not
  a fact. This is what makes `checks.py` meaningful.
- **No model in stage 02.** The HUD is structured data rendered as pixels:
  threshold → connected components → geometry filter → normalise → nearest
  template. Digit templates are *mined from Grant's own footage* (`glyphs`),
  not from a font file, and committed as `.npz` keyed by profile.
- **Version stamps drive recompute.** Bump `EXTRACTOR_VERSION` → re-decode;
  `SEGMENTER_VERSION` → spans recompute from stored L1 in milliseconds;
  `HUD_VERSION` → re-read (needs pixels, so it re-decodes).
- **`segment` must never open the video.** Recomputing spans from stored L1 is
  the whole point of the L0/L1 split, and it is what makes threshold sweeps
  free. `hud` is the one stage that legitimately re-decodes.
- **Raw media is never copied.** Manifests point at where the file lives.
- **Deaths per round is not a usable invariant** — Sage resurrect and Clove
  self-revive both let a player die twice in a round.
- Cost rule from §3: if the expensive layer ever sees more than ~1% of frames,
  stage 01 is wrong. Fix gating before buying compute.
